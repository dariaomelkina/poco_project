# Bubble Sort | Stack example Assembly program

# These instructions sort a manually 'created' list
# Directive .start contains the starting index of the list (0 in that example)
# Directive .end contains the ending index of the list (6 in that example)
# Directive .indicator contains the address, where changes indicator will be stored (10 in that example)
# Values must be manually written into the data memory after the program was assembled
# Example list: 00 30 00 20 00 00 00 10
# Result will be: 00 00 00 10 00 20 00 30

# Directives:
.start db 0
.end db 6
.indicator db 10
