### Progress Tracker

#### Basic functionality:

1. ~~RISC-Register Assembler~~
1. ~~RISC-Register Hardware Simulator *(Every instruction working, correct memory and register usage, shell output)*~~
1. ~~Temporary debug curses-interface~~
1. ~~Basic working interactive web interface~~
1. ~~Web App deployment~~
1. ~~Web App Help Pages~~
1. ~~Web App example programs access~~
1. ~~Updating the instructions sets and creating human-readable documentation~~
1. ~~Stack ISA Assembler implementation~~
1. ~~Stack ISA Simulator implementation~~
1. ~~Accumulator ISA Assembler implementation~~
1. ~~Accumulator ISA Simulator implementation~~
1. ~~Web page functionality to change memory and registers on the fly~~
1. ~~CISC ISA Assembler functionality~~
1. ~~CISC ISA Simulator functionality~~

#### Tests and additional program examples

1. ~~RISC-Register final tests for every instruction~~
1. ~~Stack ISA advanced instructions tests~~
1. ~~Accumulator ISA advanced instructions tests~~
1. ~~Alphabet output example program (Stack, Accumulator, RISC, CISC)~~
1. ~~Hello world output example program (Stack, Accumulator, RISC, CISC)~~
1. ~~Add more example programs showcasing something more or less meaningful (bubble sorting, polynomial calculation)~~

#### Bonus advanced functionality:
1. ~~Assembler working with labels (they are not included in binary code, it translates them to immediate offsets)~~
1. ~~'Next instruction' automation, configurable execution time~~
1. Breakpoints in assembly code, with configurable execution time
1. ~~Bin/Hex Instruction Representation Settings~~ 
1. Multiple programs loaded at the same time at different points. The functionality
   in the cpu is all ready (i.e. IP offsets), just need to work out an interface for that
1. Implement interrupts and change the input functionality for it to work using a buffer and interrupts
