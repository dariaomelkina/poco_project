# !!THIS INSTRUCTION SET IS DEPRECATED AND REPRESENTS AN OLD CONCEPT OF THE PROGRAM WORKFLOW!!

# Instruction Set:

* % –– register (```%reg```)
* [] –– memory location (```[mem]```)
* $ –– constant value (```$42```)

All instructions are 16-bit. As we have 32 instructions, we require 5 bits to represent the opcode, with 11 bits left for zero, one or two operands.

- - -

Using Intel-style instructions with results of computations
being saved into the first operand:

```operation destination, <----- source ```

- - -

*We are not using direct memory access unless we have to (like in accumulator architecture).
This emphasizes the complexity of CISC instructions and eases the actual programming*

- - -

## Registers that are included in every architecture:

* ### Flag register:
    * Carry flag ```cf```
    * Zero flag ```zf```
    * Overflow flag ```of```
    * Sign flag ```sf```

* ### Memory stack registers:
    * Stack pointer ```sp```
    * Link register ```lr```  (Only in RISC)

* Instruction Pointer ```ip```
